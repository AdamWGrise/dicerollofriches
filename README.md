# Circle of Riches!
Welcome to the game that lets contestants face each other in a letter-guessing, phrase-deducing battle of **_RICHES_** and **_LUXURY_**!

## What is this game?
What's more fun than playing a game by yourself? Playing a game with two other people, of course! There's nothing like racking up an arbitrary score of fake money and pretend vacations and cars, garnished with pride over being able to solve a puzzle before your friends.

Start with a word or phrase, where all you see is blanks for each of the letters and a category cluing you in as to what the solution is! Roll the dice to determine how much money will be rewarded, then guess a letter to be revealed in the puzzle. If you were right, get the amount of the reward for each of the correct instances of the letter!

Spend money to guess vowels. Finally, take a stab at solving the puzzle if you think you know it, and win the whole pot of everyone's winnings for the round! Careful, though - guess a letter or the puzzle wrong, and play continues to the next player!

## How does it work?
This app and controller are run on a Node.js and Express server along with technologies like Handlebars for the front end, web-based view. MySQL & Sequelize act as the model - the data source and repository.

The database contains tables for the solutions, game board, and players.

## How do you actually play it?
This is a web-based application that will hopefully be fairly straightforward as the project develops.

1. Go to the page and set up an account.

2. Join a game.

3. ???

4. Profit!
